To use the test file on corresponding solution, I used the jasmine standalone file which was downloaded from: https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases 

After unzipping, replace the files in the src folder with my .js file to be tested and also replace the files in the spec folder with .js test file. 

Next is to open the Specrunner.html with any text editor and change the test file and the solution links to the just added files. 

The Specrunner.html file is saved and run in a browser to execute the test. 

PS:

For "fizzBuzz.js" the test file is "testFB.js" 

For "aritGeo.js" the test file is "testAG.js" 

For "getPrimes.js" the test file is "testGP.js"
